Aim:
To develop a simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game that allows two players to compete against each other in a classic grid-based strategy game, demonstrating logic-building and problem-solving skills in programming.

Description:
The Tic Tac Toe game is a two-player board game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a cell in the grid with their respective symbols: 'X' or 'O'. The objective is to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal while preventing the opponent from doing the same.

The project includes:

Game Logic: Checking for winning conditions, handling invalid moves, and managing the flow of the game.
Player Input: Taking inputs for player moves and validating them.
User Interface: A simple text-based or graphical interface for players to interact with the game.
Game Result: Declaring the winner or determining a draw based on the game state.
